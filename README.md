# Web-Scraping-Python-Project
Project Workflow:
Setting Up and Sending Requests: The Requests library is used to send HTTP requests to the target website, retrieve HTML content, and handle responses. This step establishes a connection to the site and accesses its data.

Parsing HTML with BeautifulSoup: The HTML data is parsed with BeautifulSoup, which provides methods to navigate and search through the HTML tree. Using tags, attributes, and class selectors, specific elements such as titles, prices, reviews, or images are extracted.

Data Extraction and Cleaning: Once targeted data is located, it is extracted into a structured format, such as lists or dictionaries, for easy manipulation. Any necessary cleaning or formatting is done here to prepare the data for analysis.

Data Storage and Analysis: The collected data can be stored in a CSV file, database, or used directly within the script for analysis, reporting, or visualization.
